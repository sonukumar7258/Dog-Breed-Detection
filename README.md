# Dog-Breed-Detection
 This repository contains code for a Dog Breed Identification project. It uses a pre-trained model to predict the breed of dogs based on images. The code preprocesses images, performs inference, saves the result with overlayed breed labels, and displays images with predicted and ground truth breeds.
